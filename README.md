# Crowd counter bot

A culmination of my work for my FYP. This bot was used to demo the application of my FYP work.
Since it was a simple one-day demo, this was made to run on Google Colab on a Python notebook.

# Dependencies

As this is meant to run in Google Colab, any dependencies used are installed on run in the notebook.
